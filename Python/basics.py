# indentation  in python is very important , as it defines the scope of code
if 5 > 2 :
    print("five is greater than 2");

# if we remove this indentation , it shows Indentationerror
#if 5 > 2 : 
#print("five is greater than 2");


#* the number of spaces is up to programmer , but it has to be atleast one.




## this does not throw error
if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!") 
if 5 > 2:
        print("Five is greater than two!") 


# this does

#if 5 > 2:
# print("Five is greater than two!")
#        print("Five is greater than two!")
 
 # indentation error

#** No multiline commment  syntax in python , use # in every line

 
#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")


#* writing multiline string (non-executable , since it is not assigned to any variable)
